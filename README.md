This repo started out as a joke, where I gave claude code the instruction to "add more silly commands", repeatedly.
Now though, it does have some use with `tclaude` and `tofu k8s|gh|git`.

50+ Unix-like commands that work consistently on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

```bash
go install github.com/gigurra/tofu/cmd/tofu@latest
go install github.com/gigurra/tofu/cmd/tclaude@latest
```
