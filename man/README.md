# tofu manual pages

This directory contains supplementary documentation for tofu commands.

## Recommended: Use `--help`

For the most accurate and up-to-date information, always use the built-in help:

```
tofu --help              # List all commands
tofu <command> --help    # Help for a specific command
```

The `--help` output is always in sync with the actual command implementation, while these markdown files may occasionally be out of date.
